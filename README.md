# ConestogaCollegeProjects
This repository holds my college game projects that I did during my Unity game development course at Conestoga College for Software Engineering Technology. 

The repository is split up between the games that I created during the course.

There are 4 folders each containing containing a seperate game I created. Most of these games were made in a day or two 
and they are labled 1-4 to show when the games were made (1 is the earliest and 4 is the latest).
